## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview

```bash
npm run preview

## Environment Variables

Set these variables in your deployment platform before enabling contact and partnership forms.

### Server-side required

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend API key used by API handlers.
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: Verified sender address used for outgoing mail.
- `RESEND_EMAIL_TO`: Internal recipient inbox for form submissions.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of trusted site origins allowed to call the email API.

Example:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@axsel.africa
RESEND_EMAIL_TO=info@axsel.africa
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://axsel.africa,https://www.axsel.africa
```

### Optional

- `BACKEND_PORT`: Local Express backend port (default: `3001`).
- `VITE_EMAIL_ENDPOINT`: Frontend endpoint for submissions (default: `/api/send-email`).

### Privacy and security notes

- Keep `RESEND_API_KEY` server-only. Never expose it in client variables.
- Do not use a client-side recipient variable; recipient routing is enforced on the server.
- Keep `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` up to date for every production/staging domain.
